# ToS (READ ME!)

Self-bots are against discord's ToS, using this on servers that aren't your own will most likely get your account banned.
You could even get banned while using it on you're own server. I'm not responsible if you do.

This script is made only for testing your servers anti-spam, using bots like [sweetie](https://github.com/blackhole12/sweetiebot) etc
