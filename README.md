Self-bots are against Discord's terms of service, using this on servers that aren't your own will get your account deleted.
You could even get banned while using it on your own server. I'm not responsible if you do.

This script is made only for testing your server's anti-spam, using bots like [sweetie](https://github.com/blackhole12/sweetiebot),  etc.
